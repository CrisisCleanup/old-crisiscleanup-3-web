                      On Sept. 17, 2017 our church group was assigned to tackle a pretty sizable job via crisiscleanup.org in Jacksonville, FL in the wake of Hurricane Irma.  It was a small home on a small farm with several massive trees that needed to be cleared out.  It took 30 of us with trucks and chainsaws the better part of 3 hours working alongside the homeowner cutting and hauling.  As we got to know the homeowner better we found she had a pretty fascinating story.
                      <br><br>
                      About 7 years ago her husband was involved in a terrible car accident that left him paralyzed and wheelchair bound for life.  So to help make ends meet he actually paints these amazing paintings with his mouth and sells them.  They also do photography, host weddings and multiple other events and services on their farm to support themselves.  We also learned that they had been trying to adopt children for some time now and their home was about to be inspected to deem if they were suitable for foster children.  So the hurricane and the many downed trees were very untimely.  Her father and a friend had one chainsaw in disrepair and were looking at weeks maybe months worth of work ahead of them, time they didn't have.  Fortunately, our team showed up and took care of it in one morning to help their small business recover and hopefully adopt children one day.  She was beside herself with gratitude.

                      I was part of a Team Rubicon Remote Operation that supported the organization of clean-up assistance during both Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.  Providing assistance to individuals during, perhaps, their most difficult life experiences was humbling.  The Crisis Clean-up site is clean and easy to use.  The support received made being part of the volunteer efforts easy and rewarding.  Between calls on my scheduled shift, I would take a look at the map of submitted work orders and reflect on all of the work that I could actually see being claimed and completed.  This was useful to have a visual for the full life-cycle of the volunteer effort.  I was also aware of a great many hours that were saved by having Crisis Clean up as part of the disaster response and recovery efforts.  I am in awe of the innovative ways that the developers are using technology to meet the needs of our communities.
                      <br><br>
                      While I could not say, in good conscience, that I look forward to another opportunity to serve communities through a disaster- if and when a future situation arises, I certainly look forward to assisting through Crisis Cleanup.

                      In September 2017, I spent more than 60 hours on the phone serving on Crisis Cleanup with fellow volunteers from Team Rubicon. It was both heart-wrenching to hear first hand from Harvey and Irma survivors and gratifying to be able to assist them. Many callers expressed that Crisis Cleanup was the only call they had placed where they truly had the ear of the person to whom they were speaking and the only contact they had made to a recovery operation that gave them hope that they would not be forgotten. Crisis Cleanup is a powerful tool that clearly assists the many participating volunteer organizations in their efforts. It would be an honor to be asked to again participate on Crisis Cleanup.</p>
