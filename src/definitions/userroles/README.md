# User Roles
## Attribute Definitions
General Rules
-------------
 - All user roles are as non-heirarchical (e.g. non-inheriting permissions) as possible.
 - A user may have more than one role.
 - A user may get a new role by:
  - Selecting a role with an equal or lower level.
  - Receiving an invitation/grant from another user of the target role.
  - Requesting a role of a higher level:
   - All current users with the target role receive an alert, and may approve, deny, or ignore the request.
   - If any user with the target role approves the request, the new role is granted, and notifications are sent.
   - If any user with the target role denies the request, the role is denied, and notifications are sent.
   - If the requests are ignored, then the role will be granted after an arbitrary amount of time (e.g. 24 hours).
 - If two permissions conflict, then the user receives the more permissive role.
   - Except that if the user role is `phoneAgent`, access to other users' contact information is limited, regardless of other roles.
